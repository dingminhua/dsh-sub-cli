## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Host package `dsh-sub-cli` with a `cli_dispatch` model tool that runs an
  installed external Agent CLI headless (argv array, config isolation env,
  bounded output, exit code).
- `installSettingsSection` persistence for the unified CLI dir and a per-CLI
  three-layer model route (`provider` → `model` → `reasoningEffort`).
- Client settings card (`settings.plugin.item`) that reads the live model
  catalog via `api.llm.models`, configures the unified dir with a browse action,
  and saves the per-CLI route to the `dsh-sub-cli` settings section.
- Pure-logic modules: `registry.js` (CLI table + argv templates), `paths.js`
  (unified dir + config isolation), `status.js` (install/version detection),
  `dispatch.js` (headless subprocess dispatch).
- Unit tests for registry, paths, status, and dispatch (14 tests).

### Notes / planned

- Check-install, unified-dir migration, and live per-CLI status UI are planned
  and require `@Remote` host methods (typert) to reach the Client; they are not
  part of this first release.
